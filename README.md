Welcome to the Muffin vs. Chihuahua Image Classifier project! üêæüç∞

This project is all about having fun and practicing your machine-learning skills by building an image classifier that distinguishes between images of muffins and images of Chihuahuas. Yes, you read that right - muffins and Chihuahuas!

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to create a machine-learning model that can accurately classify images as either a muffin or a Chihuahua. It's not meant to be taken too seriously, but rather as an opportunity to explore image classification techniques and gain hands-on experience with machine learning tools.

## Dataset

We've prepared a dataset for you containing a variety of images of muffins and Chihuahuas. You can find it here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/muffin-vs-chihuahua-image-classification). The dataset is located in the `data/train` directory. You'll find two subdirectories: `muffins` and `chihuahuas`, each containing corresponding images of muffins and Chihuahuas.

## Remember

This project is all about enjoying the process of learning and experimenting. The journey matters, and the skills you gain can be applied to more serious projects in the future.
I don`t expect a super-accurate model. Even people sometimes can make mistakes with this data.
Happy coding and classifying! üê∂üç∞
